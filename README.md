# Django-Project-REST-API
I Have developed this app as a part of my MissionRnd.

This project contains an<b> OnlineApp , TodoApp, reactfe(ReactJS App)</b>.<br>
The Online app has the features like adding colleges and their student details with their marks.<br>
A REST API is used for Client Server requests and responses to POST and GET the data as a JSON DATA.<br>
REST API also contains the Authentication procedure to authenticate through the API itself.<br>
A ReactJS project which fetches the data from the django server through the API and renders the data as expected dynamic.<br>
